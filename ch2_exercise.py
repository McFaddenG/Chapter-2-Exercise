print("Griffin McFadden\n1/21/2023\nThe decision of when to use version management software is independent of the program size when talking about the number of people working on it or the program's complexity. Realistically version management software should be used regardless of the scale of the project as it only poses a benefit to the developer simply as a tool to assist in organization and documentation in every scenario. Normally one would think a large team would only benefit from something like this but even as a lone developer coming back to a project that has been untouched for months. And when it comes to teams of any size knowing who wrote what code and when can help sure that there is a common understanding of how development should continue. When the context of what is happening is kept on a timeline when considering something like backtracking to repair a problem in a previous version. Seeing how version management software is simply something that can be applied at the start of any new program it makes sense to just use it at the start.")
